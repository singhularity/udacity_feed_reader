Just open the index.html file in a browser. You'll see all the jasmine specs and test results.

<b> What Jasmine tests run? </b>
1. I've added all the tests necessary to complete the project
2. I added additional tests for the following scenarios.
    2.1 Iterate through each feed source and make sure that all entries in the feed-list
       have a href which is defined and not empty.
    2. Make sure each entry in the feed-list also has a header
3. I added tests for the future
    3.1 The first set of "future" tests assumes there will be a share link on each feed-list entry and checks
        for a button (Share button)
    3.2 The second set of "future" tests assumes each feed-list entry will have an image associated with it, any entry
        not having an image will get a placeholder image. So in future all these tests should pass.
